<p>Hi, my name is <strong>Philipp Ross</strong> and I am currently a PhD candidate at the <a href="https://www.uchicago.edu/">University of Chicago</a>. I am part of the <a href="https://biosciences.uchicago.edu/programs/">Genetics, Genomics, and Systems Biology (GGSB)</a> program and am interested in molecular puzzles.</p>
<p>Currently, as a member of the <a href="http://ejadamslab.bsd.uchicago.edu/">Adams Lab</a>, I work to understand the balance between fetal tolerance and pathogen protection at the maternal-fetal interface in humans and non-human primates.</p>
<p>Opinions expressed here do not necessarily represent those of my employer or vice versa.</p>
