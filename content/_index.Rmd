Hi, my name is **Philipp Ross** and I am currently a PhD candidate at the [University of Chicago].

I am part of the [Genetics, Genomics, and Systems Biology (GGSB)] program and am interested in molecular puzzles.

Currently, as a member of the [Adams Lab], I work to understand the balance between fetal tolerance and pathogen protection at the maternal-fetal interface in humans and non-human primates.

Opinions expressed here do not necessarily represent those of my employer or vice versa.
